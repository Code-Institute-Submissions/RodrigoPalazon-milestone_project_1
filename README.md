# Milestone_project_1 
## Personal Portfolio
---

  The main goal of this project is to share with potential employers my knowledge and skills as a programmer. 
  In my web portfolio, you can check my skills, my CV, my Certificates, my social medias, and other projects that I've already done and its source code.
  This whole project was planned,  designed responsivity, and developed by myself.

## User Experience (UX)
---
- ### User stories 

   - #### First Time Visitor Goals

      1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the programmer whom the portfolio is about and his capabilities.
      2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
      3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for different projects created and developed by the programmer that owns the portfolio, their source code, and see if they are trusted, clean and organized. I also want to locate his social media links to see his behaviour and thoughts as a human being, beyond technical skills.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find a new technical skill presented in his portfolio. This could be a new programming language, a new project that he's done, an open source code that he has been involved in,  an updated CV,  or a new certificate. 
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the professional with any questions I may have.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find a better and/or updated presentation of this project.


- ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        
        -   The two main colours used are Code Pink (#EED1E4), and Black (#171717).
    -   #### Typography
        
        -   The Poppins font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Even no being a very much usable font for websites, it was styled properly in size, spacing, weight, and color to be an easily readable font respecting all the UI concepts.

    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The rounded image of the face was designed for the potential employer to have a more clear vision to whom the portfolio belongs.


  The first image (on the left) is a mockup of the **mobile layout**.  

  The second image (on the right) is a mockup of the **desktop layout**.

  You can easily recognize that the layout is slightly different from each other, exactly because of the responsivity and how the elements will behave depending on the user size's screen device.

 ### Technologies Used:
 ---
     **HTML5**: The project uses HTML5 to describe and organize the structure of a Web page.
    
     **CSS3**: The project uses CSS3 to describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
         
     **Bootstrap 4**: The project uses Bootstrap 4 to create a high-quality responsivity and ensure that the concept "Mobile first", will be implemented properly.
    
     **Font Awesome**: The project uses **Font Awesome** to place the icons that it offers just about anywhere using a style prefix and the iconâ€™s name.

### Testing:
---
     * "you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes." 
        "You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet."*

   6. GIT Branches (Create, Merge, and Delete):

      The link beneath was used to  my understanding on the
      how to manage a branch and to create one 'layer' of security and preserve the main branch of the potential mistakes.

   7. Collapsible Icon: 
   
      For this, it was used the explanation from the official Bootstrap 4  documentation about **Accordion** as a model, and on it was made the necessary modifications    to achieve the desired result.

   8. Show and Hide Elements using jQuery:

      https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_hide_show.asp

      The example from the official documentation was used as a model to collapse and uncollapse the toggle menu. This solution was chosen because some of the item in the the toggle menu are anchor links to another part from the index.html, making the toggle menu uncollapsable by itself when some item in the menu was clicked.
