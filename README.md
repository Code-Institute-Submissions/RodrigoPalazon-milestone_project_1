# Milestone_project_1 
## Personal Portfolio
---

  The main goal of this project is to share with potential employers my knowledge and skills as a programmer. If the company that you're working for (or even your own company) needs a programmer, or if you would like to create a website for yourself, I can help you with that.
  In my web portfolio, you can check my skills, my CV, all my social medias, and other projects that I've already done.
  This whole project was designed and developed by myself. 


### UX/ UI:
---
  The first image (on the left) is a mockup of the **mobile layout**.  

  The second image (on the right) is a mockup of the **desktop layout**.

  You can easily recognize that the layout is slightly different from each other, exactly because of the responsivity and how the elements will behave depending on the user size's screen device.

 ### Technologies Used:
 ---
     **HTML5**: The project uses HTML5 to describe and organize the structure of a Web page.
    
     **CSS3**: The project uses CSS3 to describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
         
     **Bootstrap 4**: The project uses Bootstrap 4 to create a high-quality responsivity and ensure that the concept "Mobile first", will be implemented properly.
    
     **Font Awesome**: The project uses **Font Awesome** to place the icons that it offers just about anywhere using a style prefix and the iconâ€™s name.

### Testing:
---
     * "you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes." 
        "You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet."*

   6. GIT Branches (Create, Merge, and Delete):

      The link beneath was used to  my understanding on the
      how to manage a branch and to create one 'layer' of security and preserve the main branch of the potential mistakes.

   7. Collapsible Icon: 
   
      For this, it was used the explanation from the official Bootstrap 4  documentation about **Accordion** as a model, and on it was made the necessary modifications    to achieve the desired result.

   8. Show and Hide Elements using jQuery:

      https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_hide_show.asp

      The example from the official documentation was used as a model to collapse and uncollapse the toggle menu. This solution was chosen because some of the item in the the toggle menu are anchor links to another part from the index.html, making the toggle menu uncollapsable by itself when some item in the menu was clicked.
