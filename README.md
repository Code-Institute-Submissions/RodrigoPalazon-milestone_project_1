  The main goal of this project is to share with potential employers Rodrigo Palazon's knowledge and skills as a programmer. 
  In this web portfolio, you can check Rodrigo Palazon's skills, CV, Certificates, social media, and other projects that Rodrigo Palazon has already done and its source code.
  This whole project was planned, designed (considering responsivity), and developed by Rodrigo Palazon.

- ### Design

    -   #### Color Scheme
        
        -   The two main colors used are Code Pink (#EED1E4), and Black (#171717).
    -   #### Typography
        
        -   The Poppins font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in the case for any reason the main font is not being imported into the site correctly. Even no being a very much usable font for websites, it was styled properly in size, spacing, weight, and color to be an easily readable font respecting all the UI concepts.

    -   #### Imagery
        - Imagery is important. The rounded image of the face was designed for the potential employer to have a more clear vision to whom the portfolio belongs.
        - The image in the Portfolio Section gives the user a brief idea of what the specific project looks like.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

   1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about Rodrigo Palazon,  whom the portfolio is about, and his capabilities.

      1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page and/or content of their choice about Rodrigo Palazon.
      2. The main page is divided into three parts, being a Summary CV, Portfolio, and Certificates (Navigation Bar and Footer not considered in this context).  
      3. The user has two options, click on the Navigation Bar or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to know more about Rodrigo Palazon as a programmer.

   2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

      1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page, there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page or content they will end up at clearly.
      2. At the top of the main page and the "My Full CV" page there is a fixed top navigation bar to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and does not feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
      3. On the "My Full CV" Page, the options in the navigation bar change, making it easier for the user to navigate on this page.
      
   3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for different projects created and developed by Rodrigo Palazon, his portfolio, its source code and see if they are trusted, cleaned, and organized. 
     
      1. Once the new visitor has read the Summary CV, they will notice the Portfolio and Certificates sections below.
      2. At the top of any page, the user is able to click on the logo, which will be directing him straight to the top of the Home page.
      3. The visitor can see and inspect other Rodrigo Palazon's repositories by clicking on the GitHub icons available in the Summary section and Footer. In addition, the GitHub repository for a specific project is available in the Portfolio section, by clicking on the GitHub icon as well.

   4. As a First Time Visitor, I want to locate Rodrigo Palazon's social media links so I can see his behavior and thoughts as a human being, and his personality (beyond technical skills).
      
      1. The user will find the social media icons in the Summary Section, and also can scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media icons in the footer, or by clicking on the 'Social Media' option in the Navigation Bar.


   -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

   1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find a new technical skill presented in Rodrigo Palazon's portfolio. This could be a new programming language, a new project that he has done, an open-source code that he has been involved in, an updated CV, or a new certificate.

      1. This will be recognized in the Summary section when a new technical skill is learned.
      2. All the new projects will be added in the Portfolio section.
      3. All new certificates will be added in the Certificates section.

   2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with Rodrigo Palazon to be answered to any questions I might have.

      1. The Summary Section clearly highlights the icons of Email and differents Social Media, personal and professional.
      2. The footer contains links to Rodrigo Palazon's Email, LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram, and Facebook page.
      3. Whichever link I click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can get back to the website.

   3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find a better and/or updated presentation of Rodrigo Palazon's project.
      
      1. As Rodrigo Palazon progresses in his studies and accomplishments, this website will be updated and improved.


### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad, iPad Pro, iPhone6, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX, and all the Plus version of the previous mobile devices.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
### Known Bugs

- For some medium devices, and large screens the elements of the Portfolio section do not maintain the alignment properly, as expected on the UI concepts.

- For large devices, the section "Certificates" shows the Logo of the Institution the respective certificate is from, these logos are not good well manageable.
   - This bug also creates a bigger padding-bottom for the second and third certificates (Responsive Web Design, and FullStack Developer respectively).

   5. GIT Conflict issue: 

      On the commits of the May 11, 2021:
         - 19db935
         - eb4cbf5

      Rodrigo Palazon received instructions from the Software Engineer
      (and his personal friend), Ricardo Schiavetti.

   6. GIT Branches (Create, Merge, and Delete):

      The link beneath was used to  my understanding on the
      how to manage a branch and to create one 'layer' of security and preserve the main branch of the potential mistakes.

      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgzkY5vFKQQ

   7. Collapsible Icon: 
   
      For this, it was used the explanation from the official Bootstrap 4  documentation about **Accordion** as a model, and on it was made the necessary modifications to achieve the desired result.

      https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_collapse.asp

   8. Show and Hide Elements using jQuery:

      https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_hide_show.asp

      The example from the official documentation was used as a model to collapse and uncollapse the toggle menu. This solution was chosen because some of the items in the toggle menu are anchor links to another part from the index.html, making the toggle menu not collapsable by itself when some item in the menu was clicked.
